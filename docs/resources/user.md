# Resource: retool_user

A user represents an individual with access to the Retool instance. Users can be granted access to apps, resources, and workflows through group memberships and permissions.

Note: Deleting a user resource sets the user to inactive (active: false) rather than permanently removing them from Retool.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "retool_user" "example" {
  email      = "user@example.com"
  first_name = "John"
  last_name  = "Doe"
  active     = true
  metadata   = "{\"department\":\"engineering\",\"team\":\"platform\"}"
  user_type  = "standard"
}
```
