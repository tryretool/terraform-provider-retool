# Resource: retool_resource

A Retool resource represents a connection to an external service such as a database, API, or other data source.

**Important Note:** Due to API security design, the options field (which contains connection credentials and configuration) is write-only and cannot be read back after creation. This means:
- Changes to options will not be detected by Terraform after the resource is created
- The options value will not be stored in Terraform state after initial creation
- To update resource options, you must use the Retool UI or recreate the resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "retool_resource" "api" {
  display_name = "My REST API"
  type         = "restapi"

  options = jsonencode({
    base_url = "https://api.example.com"
  })

  lifecycle {
    # Ignore changes to options since they can't be read back from the API
    ignore_changes = [options]
  }
}

resource "retool_resource" "api" {
  display_name = "My REST API"
  type         = "restapi"

  options = jsonencode({
    base_url = "https://api.example.com"
    authentication_options = {
      authentication_type = "basic"
      basic_username      = "admin"
      basic_password      = "password"
    }
  })

  lifecycle {
    # Ignore changes to options since they can't be read back from the API
    ignore_changes = [options]
  }
}

resource "retool_resource" "database" {
  display_name = "Production Database"
  type         = "postgresql"

  options = jsonencode({
    host              = "db.example.com"
    port              = 5432
    database_name     = "myapp"
    database_username = var.db_username
    database_password = var.db_password
    ssl_settings = {
      ssl_enabled = true
    }
  })

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [options]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The display name of the resource.
- `options` (String, Sensitive) JSON string containing the resource configuration options. The structure varies by resource type. This field is write-only and cannot be read back after creation.
- `type` (String) The type of resource (e.g., 'restapi', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'snowflake'). Cannot be changed after creation.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) The UUID of the resource.
- `protected` (Boolean) Whether the resource is protected in source control.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp when the resource was last updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Import a Retool resource using its UUID
# Note: The options field will not be imported and must be set in your configuration
terraform import retool_resource.example "resource_uuid_here"
```
