  Manages a Retool resource (database connection, API, etc.)

# Resource: retool_resource

A Retool resource represents a connection to an external service such as a database, API, or other data source.

## Important Limitations

**⚠️ Read This Before Using:**

Due to the Retool API's security design, the `options` field (which contains connection credentials and configuration) is **write-only** and cannot be read back after creation. This means:

- **Changes to `options` will not be detected** by Terraform after the resource is created
- The `options` value will not be stored in Terraform state after initial creation  
- To update resource options, you must either:
  - Use the Retool UI to update the connection
  - Recreate the resource in Terraform
  - Use `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [options] }` if you manage options outside Terraform

This resource is best used for:
- Creating initial resource configurations that are then managed in the Retool UI
- Managing resource metadata (`display_name`, `type`) while options are managed separately  
- Infrastructure-as-code scenarios where resources are immutable after creation

## Example Usage

### REST API Resource

```terraform
resource "retool_resource" "api" {
  display_name = "My REST API"
  type         = "restapi"
  
  options = jsonencode({
    base_url = "https://api.example.com"
    authentication_options = {
      authentication_type = "None"
    }
  })
  
  lifecycle {
    # Ignore changes to options since they can't be read back
    ignore_changes = [options]
  }
}
```

###  PostgreSQL Database

```terraform
resource "retool_resource" "database" {
  display_name = "Production Database"
  type         = "postgresql"
  
  options = jsonencode({
    host                    = "db.example.com"
    port                    = 5432
    database_name           = "myapp"
    database_username       = var.db_username
    database_password       = var.db_password
    ssl_settings = {
      ssl_enabled = true
    }
  })
  
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [options]
  }
}
```

### REST API with Bearer Auth

```terraform
resource "retool_resource" "authenticated_api" {
  display_name = "Authenticated API"
  type         = "restapi"
  
  options = jsonencode({
    base_url = "https://api.example.com"
    authentication_options = {
      authentication_type = "bearer"
      bearer_token        = var.api_token
    }
    headers = [
      ["Content-Type", "application/json"]
    ]
  })
  
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [options]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `display_name` (String) The display name of the resource.
- `options` (String, Sensitive) JSON string containing the resource configuration options. The structure varies by resource type. This field is write-only and cannot be read back after creation.
- `type` (String) The type of resource (e.g., 'restapi', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'snowflake'). Cannot be changed after creation.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) The UUID of the resource.
- `protected` (Boolean) Whether the resource is protected in source control.
- `updated_at` (String) The timestamp when the resource was last updated.

## Import

Resources can be imported using their ID. Note that the `options` field will not be imported and must be set in your configuration.

```shell
terraform import retool_resource.example "resource_uuid_here"
```

After import, you should add `lifecycle { ignore_changes = [options] }` to prevent Terraform from trying to update the options field.
