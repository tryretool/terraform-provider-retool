  The Retool provider can be used to interact with 
  [Retool Platform API](https://docs.retool.com/org-users/quickstart#retool-api) to configure your Retool instance and Spaces.

# Retool Provider

Retool Terraform provider helps you configure Spaces, SSO, Source Control, permissions and other settings on 
self-hosted Retool instance or Retool Cloud organization using [Retool Platform API](https://docs.retool.com/org-users/quickstart#retool-api).

## Prerequisites
Your [Retool plan](https://retool.com/pricing) should support Platform APIs. You'll need to create an API token on **Settings > Retool API** .

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "retool" {
  host         = "your-retool-instance.com"
  scheme       = "https"
  access_token = "your-access-token"
}


# Create an app folder
resource "retool_folder" "production_apps" {
  name        = "Production Apps"
  folder_type = "app"
}

# Create a permission group
resource "retool_group" "production_apps_users" {
  name = "Production Apps Users"
}

# Grant "use" permissions on the folder to the permission group
resource "retool_permissions" "production_apps_users" {
  subject = {
    type = "group"
    id   = retool_folder.production_apps_users.id
  }
  permissions = [
    {
      object = {
        type = "folder"
        id   = retool_folder.production_apps.id
      }
      access_level = "use"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `access_token` (String, Sensitive) The access token for the Retool API
- `host` (String) The host of the Retool instance, organization or Space, e.g. 'example.retool.com'
- `requests_per_minute` (Number) The number of requests per minute to allow to the Retool API. Set to 45 by default. Set to -1 to disable rate limiting.
- `scheme` (String) The scheme of the Retool instance, e.g. 'https'

## Environment Variables

You can provide your credentials via the `RETOOL_HOST`, `RETOOL_SCHEME` and `RETOOL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
environment variables, respectively.

```terraform
provider "retool" {
}


# Create an app folder
resource "retool_folder" "production_apps" {
  name        = "Production Apps"
  folder_type = "app"
}

# Create a permission group
resource "retool_group" "production_apps_users" {
  name = "Production Apps Users"
}

# Grant "use" permissions on the folder to the permission group
resource "retool_permissions" "production_apps_users" {
  subject = {
    type = "group"
    id   = retool_folder.production_apps_users.id
  }
  permissions = [
    {
      object = {
        type = "folder"
        id   = retool_folder.production_apps.id
      }
      access_level = "use"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example Usage

```shell
RETOOL_HOST="your-retool-instance.com" \
RETOOL_SCHEME="https" \
RETOOL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token" \
terraform plan
```

## Rate limiting
Retool API has rate limits. In order to avoid hitting the rate limits, Retool Terraform provider is configured to limit requests to the API to 45 requests per minute.
This might be too slow for complex Retool configurations with a lot of folders and permission groups. To increase the rate limit, you can do the following:

- Disable rate limiting on your self-hosted Retool instance by setting `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT` environment variable to `true`.

- Increase the rate limit on your self-hosted Retool instance by setting `API_CALLS_PER_MIN` environment variable higher than its default value of 300.

Once you've increased the rate limit, you can increase the `requests_per_minute` parameter in the provider configuration.

```terraform
provider "retool" {
  requests_per_minute = 100
}
```

Or you can disable rate limiting in the provider completely by setting `requests_per_minute` to `-1`.

```terraform
provider "retool" {
  requests_per_minute = -1
}
```
